This project implements a Python script to explore Oppermann’s Conjecture. The conjecture proposes that for any integer n > 1, there is at least one prime number between n^2 - n and n^2 + n.

Features
Prime Number Checker: Determines whether a given number is prime.
Prime Generation: Generates all prime numbers up to n^2 for a given n.
Oppermann’s Conjecture Test: Checks for prime numbers in the range n^2 - n to n^2 + n to validate the conjecture.
